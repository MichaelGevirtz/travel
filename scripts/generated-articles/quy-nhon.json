  "content": "# Quy Nhon Travel Guide 2026: Beaches Without the Crowds\n\nQuy Nhon is what [Nha Trang](/vietnam/destinations/nha-trang) was 20 years ago - a working Vietnamese coastal city with good beaches, excellent seafood, and minimal tourism infrastructure. It's not undiscovered, but it remains refreshingly undeveloped compared to Vietnam's major beach destinations.\n\nLocated on the south-central coast, Quy Nhon attracts travelers seeking authenticity over amenities.
