  "content": "# Con Dao Travel Guide 2026: Remote Island Paradise & History\n\nCon Dao is Vietnam's most beautiful and least accessible beach destination. This archipelago of 16 islands off the southern coast offers pristine beaches, excellent diving, and a haunting history as a colonial-era prison camp. It's expensive to reach and has limited accommodation, which keeps it exclusive and unspoiled.\n\nFor a century, Con Dao was \"Devil's Island\" - a brutal prison where French colonizers and later South Vietnamese held political prisoners. Today, the prisons are museums and the beaches are paradise. It's a strange and powerful combination.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Location:** 180km off southern Vietnam coast\n- **Coordinates:** 8.6922°N, 106.6108°E\n- **Region:** South Vietnam (Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province)\n- **Best Time to Visit:** March to September (calm seas)\n- **Monsoon Season:** October to February (rough seas, some closures)\n- **From Ho Chi Minh City:** 45 minutes by flight\n- **From Vung Tau:** 12 hours by ferry (infrequent)\n\n## Top Attractions\n\n### Beaches\n\n**Dam Trau Beach:** The most famous - white sand, clear water, jungle backdrop.

The diving is excellent and the beaches are Vietnam's best. It's not a budget destination.\n\n**How many days for Con Dao?**\n\n3-4 days is ideal. Enough to see the prisons, hit the beaches, and do some diving. Fewer days feels rushed given travel logistics.",
