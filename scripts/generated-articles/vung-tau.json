  "content": "# Vung Tau Travel Guide 2026: Beach Escape Near Ho Chi Minh City\n\nVung Tau is Ho Chi Minh City's beach. Just 2 hours southeast of the metropolis, this coastal city is where Saigonese escape on weekends for seafood, swimming, and sea breezes. It's not Vietnam's prettiest beach destination, but it's the most accessible from the south's biggest city.\n\nOnce a French colonial retreat called Cap Saint-Jacques, Vung Tau retains some of that heritage in its lighthouse, villas, and the enormous Christ the King statue that overlooks the city. For travelers, it's either a quick beach break from [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city) or a jumping-off point for ferries to [Con Dao](/vietnam/destinations/con-dao).\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Location:** Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, Southern Coast\n- **Coordinates:** 10.3460°N, 107.0843°E\n- **Region:** South Vietnam\n- **Best Time to Visit:** November to April (dry season)\n- **Rainy Season:** May to October\n- **Currency:** Vietnamese Dong (VND) - $1 USD = 24,000 VND (2026 rates)\n- **Population:** 530,000\n- **Nearest Airport:** Tan Son Nhat (SGN), Ho Chi Minh City - 95km\n- **From Ho Chi Minh City:** 95km / 2 hours by car or 1.5 hours by hydrofoil\n\n## Why Visit Vung Tau\n\nVung Tau serves a specific purpose - beach access without flights or long bus rides from HCMC.\n\n### Closest Beach to HCMC\n\nNo other beach is as accessible from Ho Chi Minh City. You can leave in the morning, spend the day on the beach, and be back for dinner. Or stay overnight for a proper weekend escape.\n\n### Seafood Paradise\n\nFresh seafood at reasonable prices is Vung Tau's strength. The fishing fleet brings in daily catches, and restaurants along the beach serve it grilled, steamed, or in hot pot.\n\n### Con Dao Gateway\n\nHigh-speed ferries to Con Dao depart from Vung Tau. If you're heading to Vietnam's most pristine islands, you'll likely pass through here.\n\n### Local Beach Culture\n\nThis isn't a tourist beach - it's where Vietnamese families vacation. The atmosphere is local, the prices are fair, and you'll experience a side of Vietnam that international tourists often miss.\n\n## Top Attractions\n\n### Christ the King Statue (Tuong Dai Chua Kito Vua)\n\nA 32-meter Jesus statue on Small Mountain, arms outstretched over the city.
