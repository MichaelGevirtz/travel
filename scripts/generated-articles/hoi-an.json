  "content": "# Hoi An Travel Guide 2026: Ancient Town, Tailors & Lantern-Lit Nights\n\nHoi An is Vietnam at its most photogenic. This small town in central Vietnam was once a major trading port, and the old merchant houses, Chinese temples, and Japanese bridge have been preserved so well that UNESCO made the whole Ancient Town a World Heritage Site. Today, it's famous for three things: lantern-lit streets, custom tailoring, and some of the best food in Vietnam.\n\nLocated 30km south of Da Nang on the Thu Bon River, Hoi An makes an ideal base for exploring central Vietnam. The town is compact enough to walk everywhere, the beach is just 4km away, and you're close to the My Son ruins and Marble Mountains. This guide covers everything you need to know to plan your trip.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Location:** Central Vietnam, Thu Bon River\n- **Coordinates:** 15.8801°N, 108.3380°E\n- **Region:** Central Vietnam\n- **Best Time to Visit:** February to May (dry season, cooler weather)\n- **Worst Time:** October to November (flooding season)\n- **Currency:** Vietnamese Dong (VND) - $1 USD = 24,000 VND (2026 rates)\n- **Language:** Vietnamese (English widely spoken in tourist areas)\n- **Population:** 120,000\n- **Nearest Airport:** Da Nang International Airport (DAD) - 30km / 45 minutes\n- **From Hanoi:** 800km / 1.5 hours by flight to Da Nang + 45 min transfer\n- **From Ho Chi Minh City:** 860km / 1.5 hours by flight to Da Nang + 45 min transfer\n\n## Why Visit Hoi An\n\nHoi An is different from anywhere else in Vietnam. The Ancient Town has been preserved almost exactly as it was 200 years ago - no motorbikes are allowed inside, the buildings are original, and the whole place glows yellow and orange when the lanterns come on at night.\n\n### Perfect for Every Traveler\n\nThis town works for everyone. Couples love the romantic riverside restaurants and evening lantern boat rides. Shoppers go crazy at the tailors and leather shops. Foodies find some of Vietnam's best regional dishes here. Even families enjoy the relaxed pace compared to Hanoi or [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city).\n\n### The Tailoring Scene\n\nHoi An is famous for custom clothing. You can get a suit, dress, or shoes made in 24-48 hours for a fraction of Western prices. A custom suit runs **$100-200**, dresses start at **$30-50**, and leather shoes cost **$40-80**. The quality varies wildly between shops, so do your research.\n\n### A Living Museum\n\nWhat makes Hoi An special is that it's not a museum - people still live and work here. The old merchant houses have been converted into cafes and shops, but the architecture remains. Walking through the narrow lanes at dusk, with lanterns swaying overhead and the smell of cooking wafting from doorways, feels like stepping back in time.\n\n### The Food\n\nCentral Vietnamese cuisine is distinct from the north and south, and Hoi An has its own specialties you won't find anywhere else: cao lau (thick noodles with pork), white rose dumplings, and the country's best banh mi. More on that later.\n\n## Top Attractions\n\nThe Ancient Town is small enough to see everything in a day, but you'll want to slow down and soak it in.\n\n### Japanese Covered Bridge\n\nThe symbol of Hoi An. This 400-year-old bridge was built by the Japanese community and has a small temple inside. It's most photogenic at night when lit up.\n\n- **Entry:** Included in Old Town ticket (**$5**)\n- **Best time:** Sunset or after dark\n- **Time needed:** 15-20 minutes\n\n### Ancient Town Walking\n\nThe real attraction is wandering the lanes. Yellow buildings, lanterns everywhere, no traffic noise. Pop into old merchant houses, assembly halls, and tiny temples. Every corner is a photo opportunity.\n\n- **Entry:** **$5** ticket covers 5 attractions\n- **Best time:** Early morning (7-9am) or evening (5-8pm)\n- **Time needed:** 2-4 hours minimum\n\n### An Bang Beach\n\n4km from town, this is Hoi An's main beach. It's developed but not overdone - beach clubs, restaurants, and sun loungers without the chaos of Nha Trang. The water is calm and good for swimming from April to September.\n\n- **Entry:** Free (loungers **$3-5**)\n- **Best time:** Morning or late afternoon\n- **Time needed:** Half day\n\n### Lantern Boat Ride\n\nEvery evening, small wooden boats cruise the Thu Bon River. You release paper lanterns into the water while floating past the glowing Ancient Town. Touristy? Yes. Worth it? Also yes.\n\n- **Cost:** **$3-5** per person\n- **Best time:** After dark (7-9pm)\n- **Duration:** 20-30 minutes\n\n### My Son Sanctuary\n\nThese Cham temple ruins are Vietnam's mini Angkor Wat, located 40km from Hoi An. The Hindu temples date back to the 4th century. Go early to beat the heat and tour buses.\n\n- **Entry:** **$10**\n- **Best time:** Sunrise tour (leave at 5am)\n- **Time needed:** Half day including transport\n\n### Tra Que Vegetable Village\n\nThis 300-year-old farming village supplies Hoi An's restaurants. Take a cooking class, learn about organic farming, and eat incredibly fresh food.\n\n- **Cost:** Cooking class **$25-35**\n- **Time needed:** Half day\n\n## Where to Stay\n\nHoi An is compact. Anywhere within 2km of the Ancient Town works well.\n\n### Ancient Town (Best for First-Timers)\n\nStay inside or on the edge of the Ancient Town for maximum atmosphere. You'll pay a premium but can walk to everything. Most places are small boutique hotels in converted buildings.\n\n**Price range:** **$40-100/night** for nice hotels\n\nThe downside: streets are pedestrian-only, so getting your luggage in can be awkward. Some hotels offer motorbike pickup from the edge of the zone.\n\n### An Hoi Peninsula (Best Value)\n\nJust across the bridge from the Ancient Town, this area has the same riverside views at lower prices. You're still within a 5-minute walk of everything but get more space and often a pool.\n\n**Price range:** **$25-60/night**\n\nThis is where I usually stay - you get the location without paying Ancient Town premiums.\n\n### An Bang Beach (Best for Beach Lovers)\n\nIf you want to split time between town and beach, stay here. It's a **$3** Grab ride or 15-minute bike ride to the Ancient Town. More resorts and beach vibe.\n\n**Price range:** **$30-80/night**\n\nGreat for families or if you're planning multiple beach days.\n\n### Cam Thanh (Best for Peace and Quiet)\n\nThis village area south of town has rice paddies, coconut palms, and a slower pace. You'll need a bike or scooter to get around, but it's beautiful and quiet.\n\n**Price range:** **$20-50/night**\n\n## Food and Dining\n\nHoi An might have the best food scene in Vietnam. The local specialties alone are worth the trip.\n\n### Must-Try Dishes\n\n**Cao Lau** - Thick rice noodles with pork, crispy wontons, and fresh herbs in a small amount of broth. The noodles are supposedly made only with water from a specific well. Find it at the central market for **$1.50**.\n\n**White Rose Dumplings** - Delicate shrimp dumplings that look like white roses. Only one family in Hoi An makes them, and all the restaurants buy from them. **$2-3** for a plate.\n\n**Banh Mi Phuong** - Anthony Bourdain called this the best sandwich in the world. The crispy bread, pate, and pickled vegetables are perfect. **$1.50** at the famous shop on Phan Chau Trinh street.\n\n**Com Ga (Chicken Rice)** - Hoi An's version is made with turmeric rice and shredded chicken. Simple but addictive. **$2-3**.\n\n**Banh Bao Banh Vac** - White rose dumplings' cousin, also unique to Hoi An.\n\n### Where to Eat\n\n**Central Market** - Best for cheap local food. Find cao lau, banh mi, and fresh fruit. Go for breakfast or lunch.\n\n**Madam Khanh** - Another legendary banh mi shop, often called \"The Banh Mi Queen.\" Less famous than Phuong but equally good.\n\n**Morning Glory** - Ms. Vy's restaurant serving refined central Vietnamese dishes. Great for a nicer dinner. **$8-15** per dish.\n\n**Streets Restaurant** - Social enterprise training disadvantaged youth. Excellent food and a good cause. **$5-10** per dish.\n\n### Cooking Classes\n\nHoi An is the best place in Vietnam to take a cooking class. Most include a market visit, boat ride to a farm, and hands-on cooking.\n\n- **Red Bridge Cooking School:** The original, **$35-50**\n- **Tra Que Water Wheel:** Farm-to-table focus, **$30-40**\n- **Green Bamboo Cooking School:** Budget option, **$25-30**\n\n## Getting Around\n\n### Getting to Hoi An\n\n**By Air:** Fly into Da Nang (DAD), then take a taxi or Grab (**$15-20**, 45 minutes) or shuttle bus (**$5**, 1 hour). There's no airport in Hoi An.\n\n**From [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi):**\n- Flight to Da Nang: 1.5 hours, **$50-100**\n- Train to Da Nang: 15-17 hours, **$35-60** for soft sleeper\n\n**From Ho Chi Minh City:**\n- Flight to Da Nang: 1.5 hours, **$50-100**\n- Bus: 18-20 hours (not recommended)\n\n**From [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue):**\n- Bus over Hai Van Pass: 3-4 hours, **$8-12**\n- Train to Da Nang + taxi: 3 hours total, **$15-25**\n\n### Getting Around Town\n\n**Walking:** The Ancient Town is pedestrian-only and tiny. You can walk across it in 15 minutes.\n\n**Bicycle:** The best way to get around. Most hotels offer free bikes or rent them for **$1-2/day**. The town is flat and bike-friendly.\n\n**Motorbike:** Rent for **$5-7/day** to reach the beach, My Son, or surrounding villages. International driving permit technically required.\n\n**Grab:** Available and cheap. **$1-3** for most trips in town, **$3-5** to the beach.\n\n## Budget Guide\n\n### Budget Travelers ($25-40/day)\n\nHoi An is affordable if you stick to local food and free activities.\n\n- **Hostel dorm:** **$6-10**\n- **Local meals:** **$5-8** (banh mi, cao lau, com ga)\n- **Ancient Town ticket:** **$5** (covers multiple days)\n- **Bike rental:** **$1-2**\n- **Beer:** **$0.50-1** (bia hoi)\n\nYou can eat incredibly well for almost nothing here. The central market breakfast alone is worth the trip.\n\n### Mid-Range Travelers ($50-80/day)\n\n- **Nice hotel with pool:** **$30-50**\n- **Mix of local and restaurant meals:** **$15-20**\n- **Cooking class:** **$30**\n- **Grab rides:** **$5**\n- **Lantern boat ride:** **$5**\n\nAt this budget, you can take a cooking class, eat at nicer restaurants, and stay somewhere with a pool.\n\n### Luxury Travelers ($150+/day)\n\nHoi An has excellent luxury options at reasonable prices.\n\n- **Boutique hotel/resort:** **$100-200**\n- **Fine dining:** **$30-50**\n- **Private cooking class:** **$80-100**\n- **Custom tailoring:** **$100-300** per item\n- **Spa treatments:** **$30-60**\n\nThe Anantara and Four Seasons Nam Hai are the top-end options if money isn't a concern.\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Best Time to Visit\n\n**February to May** is ideal - dry, warm (25-30°C), and not too crowded. June to August is hot and humid but still good for beach days.\n\n**Avoid October to November** if possible. This is flooding season, and the Ancient Town can be underwater. It happens almost every year. The locals are used to it, but it's not ideal for tourists.\n\n### The Tailoring Game\n\nIf you're getting clothes made:\n\n1. Research shops beforehand (TripAdvisor reviews help)\n2. Bring pictures of exactly what you want\n3. Don't rush - allow 2-3 days for fittings\n4. Inspect carefully before paying the balance\n5. Get recommended shops from your hotel, not street touts\n\nPopular choices: Yaly Couture (high-end), Bebe (good value), A Dong Silk (established).\n\n### Avoiding Crowds\n\n- Visit the Ancient Town early morning (7-9am) or during lunch (12-2pm)\n- Full moon nights (14th of each lunar month) are magical but packed\n- The further from the Japanese Bridge, the fewer tourists\n\n### Nearby Destinations\n\nHoi An is perfectly positioned for day trips:\n\n| Destination | Distance | Travel Time | Direction |\n|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|\n| [Da Nang](/vietnam/destinations/da-nang) | 30km | 45 min by car | North |\n| [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue) | 122km | 2.5 hours by car | North |\n| My Son Sanctuary | 40km | 1 hour by car | West |\n| Marble Mountains | 20km | 30 min by car | North |\n| Cham Islands | 18km | 30 min by boat | East |\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n- **Don't** try to see Hoi An in a day trip from Da Nang - stay overnight for the lantern magic\n- **Don't** eat only at tourist restaurants - the market food is better and cheaper\n- **Don't** rush the tailoring - bad fits happen when you don't allow enough time\n- **Don't** skip the bicycle - it's the best way to experience the town\n- **Don't** visit only the Ancient Town - the beach and villages are worth your time\n\n### Etiquette\n\n- Dress modestly when visiting temples (cover shoulders and knees)\n- Ask before photographing locals, especially at the market\n- Bargain gently at markets but not at restaurants\n- Remove shoes when entering homes and some shops\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How many days do you need in Hoi An?**\n\n3-4 days is ideal.
