  "content": "# Da Nang Travel Guide 2026: Beaches, Bridges & Ba Na Hills\n\nDa Nang is Vietnam's most underrated city. While most travelers rush through to [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an) or [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue), those who stop discover a clean, modern coastal city with excellent beaches, impressive bridges, and easy access to some of Vietnam's best attractions.\n\nThink of Da Nang as Vietnam's Miami - beach resorts line the coast, the infrastructure is modern, and there's a genuine city vibe rather than a tourist town feel. Located in central Vietnam between the ancient capitals and beach destinations, it's the perfect hub for exploring the region.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Location:** Central Vietnam, South China Sea coast\n- **Coordinates:** 16.0544°N, 108.2022°E\n- **Region:** Central Vietnam\n- **Best Time to Visit:** February to May (dry, warm)\n- **Rainy Season:** September to December\n- **Currency:** Vietnamese Dong (VND) - $1 USD = 24,000 VND (2026 rates)\n- **Population:** 1.2 million\n- **Nearest Airport:** Da Nang International Airport (DAD) - in the city\n- **From Hanoi:** 764km / 1.5 hours by flight\n- **From Ho Chi Minh City:** 960km / 1.5 hours by flight\n\n## Why Visit Da Nang\n\nDa Nang has transformed from a sleepy port into Vietnam's most modern city. The infrastructure is excellent, the beach is right in town, and you can use it as a base for the entire central region.\n\n### Beach Life in the City\n\nMy Khe Beach runs along the entire eastern edge of the city - Forbes once named it one of the most luxurious beaches in the world. You can be on the sand within 15 minutes of anywhere in town.\n\n### The Bridge Collection\n\nDa Nang is obsessed with bridges. The Dragon Bridge breathes fire on weekends. The Golden Bridge at Ba Na Hills has giant stone hands holding it up. The Love Lock Bridge glows with lights. They're cheesy and magnificent.\n\n### Central Location\n\nDa Nang sits perfectly between major attractions:\n- [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an): 30 minutes south\n- [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue): 2 hours north\n- Ba Na Hills: 45 minutes west\n- Marble Mountains: 15 minutes south\n\n### Modern Infrastructure\n\nThis city works. Roads are good, traffic is manageable, Grab is everywhere, and you can find anything you need. After the chaos of Hanoi or HCMC, Da Nang feels refreshingly organized.\n\n## Top Attractions\n\n### My Khe Beach\n\nThis 10km stretch of white sand is Da Nang's main draw. The water is warm, the waves are good for surfing, and beach clubs offer loungers and food.\n\n- **Entry:** Free\n- **Best time:** Early morning (6-8am) or late afternoon (4-6pm)\n- **Water sports:** Surfing, jet skiing, parasailing available\n\n### Dragon Bridge\n\nA 666-meter bridge shaped like a dragon. On weekend nights at 9pm, it breathes fire and water. It sounds ridiculous but draws huge crowds.\n\n- **Fire show:** Saturday and Sunday, 9pm\n- **Best view:** East side of the river\n- **Cost:** Free\n\n### Ba Na Hills & Golden Bridge\n\nThis French-colonial themed hill station is 1,400 meters up in the mountains. The famous Golden Bridge - held by giant stone hands - is here, along with a cable car, French village, and amusement park.\n\n- **Entry:** **$35-40** including cable car\n- **Getting there:** 45 minutes from Da Nang\n- **Time needed:** Full day\n\n### Marble Mountains\n\nFive limestone hills with Buddhist caves, pagodas, and panoramic views. The elevator saves the climb, but the stairs through the caves are the real experience.\n\n- **Entry:** **$3**, elevator **$2** extra\n- **Time needed:** 2-3 hours\n- **Best time:** Early morning to avoid heat\n\n### Son Tra Peninsula (Monkey Mountain)\n\nA forested peninsula with beaches, viewpoints, and the 67-meter Lady Buddha statue at Linh Ung Pagoda. Good for a half-day motorbike loop.\n\n- **Entry:** Free\n- **Best experience:** Rent a motorbike and drive the coastal road\n- **Time needed:** Half day\n\n### Han Market\n\nDa Nang's central market for local food, souvenirs, and atmosphere. Less touristy than markets in Hoi An or HCMC.\n\n- **Entry:** Free\n- **Best time:** Morning for food, evening for atmosphere\n- **Must try:** Banh xeo, mi quang\n\n## Where to Stay\n\n### My Khe Beach (Best for Beach Lovers)\n\nMost visitors stay along My Khe Beach. High-rise hotels and resorts line the waterfront, with the beach just steps away. This is where you'll find the best swimming and sunrise views.\n\n**Price range:** **$40-150/night**\n\nThe Hyatt, Pullman, and Furama are the luxury options. Plenty of mid-range hotels offer beach views for **$50-80**.\n\n### City Center / Han River (Best for Nightlife)\n\nStay near the river for bridge views, rooftop bars, and easy access to restaurants. You're 10-15 minutes from the beach but closer to the city vibe.\n\n**Price range:** **$25-80/night**\n\nGood option if you want more than just beach time.\n\n### Son Tra Peninsula (Best for Peace)\n\nSecluded resorts on the peninsula offer privacy and nature. The InterContinental is the standout, but you'll need transport to get anywhere.\n\n**Price range:** **$150-400/night**\n\n## Food and Dining\n\nCentral Vietnamese cuisine is distinct - more seafood, different noodles, and flavors you won't find in the north or south.\n\n### Must-Try Dishes\n\n**Mi Quang** - Da Nang's signature dish. Wide yellow noodles with pork, shrimp, peanuts, and herbs in a small amount of turmeric broth. Different from pho - fewer noodles, less soup. **$1.50-2.50**\n\n**Banh Xeo** - Central Vietnamese crispy pancakes, smaller and crispier than southern versions. Filled with shrimp and pork. **$2-3**\n\n**Bun Cha Ca** - Fish cake noodle soup, a Da Nang breakfast specialty. **$1.50-2**\n\n**Seafood** - Fresh and cheap. Whole grilled fish, steamed crab, garlic shrimp. Head to the seafood restaurants along My Khe Beach. **$10-20** for a feast.\n\n**Banh Trang Cuon Thit Heo** - Pork and rice paper rolls. You wrap your own at the table. **$3-5**\n\n### Where to Eat\n\n**Ba Duong** - The most famous banh xeo in Da Nang. Always packed. Cash only.\n\n**Mi Quang Ba Mua** - Locals' choice for mi quang. Multiple locations.\n\n**Quan Hai San Be Man** - Seafood restaurant where you pick your fish from tanks. On the beach road.\n\n**Madame Lan** - Upscale Vietnamese in a French villa. Good for a nice dinner. **$15-25**\n\n**Sky36** - Rooftop bar on the 36th floor. Not for food, but the views are worth a drink.\n\n## Getting Around\n\n### Getting to Da Nang\n\n**By Air:** Da Nang International Airport is 3km from the city center. Grab to your hotel costs **$3-8**. Direct flights from Hanoi, HCMC, Singapore, Bangkok, and more.\n\n**From [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi):**\n- Flight: 1.5 hours, **$50-100**\n- Train: 15-17 hours, **$35-60** soft sleeper\n\n**From Ho Chi Minh City:**\n- Flight: 1.5 hours, **$50-100**\n- Train: 16-18 hours, **$40-65** soft sleeper\n\n**From [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an):**\n- Grab/Taxi: 30-45 minutes, **$15-20**\n- Local bus: 1 hour, **$1**\n\n### Getting Around Town\n\n**Grab:** The easiest option. Bikes and cars available. Most trips **$2-5**.\n\n**Motorbike:** Rent for **$5-8/day**. Traffic is manageable compared to other Vietnamese cities.\n\n**Bicycle:** Good for the beach area. Hotels often provide free bikes.\n\n**Taxi:** Metered taxis are honest here. Mai Linh and Vinasun are reliable.\n\n## Budget Guide\n\n### Budget Travelers ($30-45/day)\n\nDa Nang is great value for a beach city.\n\n- **Hostel/basic hotel:** **$10-15**\n- **Local food:** **$8-12** (mi quang, banh xeo, street food)\n- **Beach:** Free\n- **Transport:** **$5-8** (Grab, buses)\n- **One attraction:** **$5-10**\n\n### Mid-Range Travelers ($60-100/day)\n\n- **Beach hotel with pool:** **$40-60**\n- **Mix of local and restaurant meals:** **$15-25**\n- **Ba Na Hills day trip:** **$40** (entry + transport)\n- **Grab everywhere:** **$10**\n\n### Luxury Travelers ($150+/day)\n\n- **5-star beach resort:** **$100-200**\n- **Fine dining:** **$40-60**\n- **Private tours:** **$80-120**\n- **Spa/wellness:** **$30-50**\n\nThe Hyatt, InterContinental, and Furama deliver proper luxury at lower prices than Western equivalents.\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Best Time to Visit\n\n**February to May** is ideal - dry season with comfortable temperatures (25-30°C).\n\n**June to August** is hot (35°C+) but good for beach and surfing.\n\n**September to December** brings rain and occasional typhoons.
