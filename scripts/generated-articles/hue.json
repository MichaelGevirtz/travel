  "content": "# Hue Travel Guide 2026: Imperial Citadel, Royal Tombs & History\n\nHue is where Vietnam's royal past comes alive. As the imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty from 1802 to 1945, this city on the Perfume River is filled with palaces, tombs, temples, and pagodas that survived (mostly) the wars of the 20th century. It's Vietnam's most historically significant city and home to its most refined cuisine.\n\nLocated in central Vietnam between [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi) and [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city), Hue sits along the Perfume River with the massive Imperial Citadel on the north bank and the modern city on the south.

One day for the Citadel and city, one for the tombs and pagodas. Add a day for a boat trip, cooking class, or DMZ tour.\n\n**Is Hue worth visiting?**\n\nYes, if you have any interest in history or culture. The Citadel and tombs are genuinely impressive, and the food is unique. Skip it only if you're purely focused on beaches.\n\n**Hue or Hoi An?**\n\nDifferent experiences. Hue is about imperial history and refined cuisine. Hoi An is about preserved merchant architecture and tailoring. Most travelers visit both - they're only 2.5 hours apart.\n\n**Is Hue spicy?**\n\nYes. Hue cuisine is the spiciest in Vietnam. If you can't handle heat, ask for \"khong cay\" (no spicy). But try the real thing first - bun bo Hue without spice isn't really bun bo Hue.",
