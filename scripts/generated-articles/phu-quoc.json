  "content": "# Phu Quoc Travel Guide 2026: Island Paradise, Beaches & Seafood\n\nPhu Quoc is Vietnam's answer to Thailand's islands - white sand beaches, clear turquoise water, and sunsets over the Gulf of Thailand. But unlike Phuket or Koh Samui, it's still developing, which means you can find quiet beaches, reasonable prices, and fewer crowds if you know where to look.\n\nLocated in the Gulf of Thailand closer to Cambodia than mainland Vietnam, Phu Quoc became Vietnam's first special economic zone and has been building resorts and infrastructure rapidly. The north is developed with resorts, the south has the main town and night markets, and everywhere in between has beaches worth discovering.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Location:** Gulf of Thailand, Kien Giang Province\n- **Coordinates:** 10.2899°N, 103.9840°E\n- **Region:** South Vietnam\n- **Island Size:** 574 km² (Vietnam's largest island)\n- **Best Time to Visit:** November to March (dry season)\n- **Rainy Season:** July to September\n- **Currency:** Vietnamese Dong (VND) - $1 USD = 24,000 VND (2026 rates)\n- **Population:** 180,000\n- **Nearest Airport:** Phu Quoc International Airport (PQC) - on the island\n- **From Ho Chi Minh City:** 300km / 1 hour by flight\n- **From Hanoi:** 1,850km / 2 hours by flight\n\n## Why Visit Phu Quoc\n\nPhu Quoc offers a proper beach vacation that's hard to find elsewhere in Vietnam. The beaches are legitimately good, the seafood is fresh, and the sunsets are spectacular.\n\n### Real Beaches\n\nUnlike [Nha Trang](/vietnam/destinations/nha-trang) or [Da Nang](/vietnam/destinations/da-nang) where beaches are urban, Phu Quoc's best beaches feel tropical and uncrowded. Sao Beach has soft white sand that rivals anywhere in Southeast Asia.\n\n### Seafood Paradise\n\nAs a fishing island, Phu Quoc has some of Vietnam's best seafood. The night market in Duong Dong is a feast - grilled squid, whole fish, crab, and oysters at prices that seem too cheap.\n\n### Sunset Island\n\nPhu Quoc faces west, meaning every evening brings golden hour views over the Gulf of Thailand. Long Beach is lined with bars designed for exactly this experience.\n\n### Less Developed (For Now)\n\nDevelopment is accelerating, but you can still find empty beaches and local fishing villages. Visit now before it becomes Vietnam's Bali.\n\n## Top Attractions\n\n### Sao Beach (Bai Sao)\n\nThe postcard beach. Powdery white sand, shallow turquoise water, palm trees leaning over the shore. It's developed with beach clubs but still beautiful. The southern end is quieter than the main entrance.\n\n- **Entry:** Free (beach chairs **$3-5**)\n- **Best time:** Morning before crowds\n- **Tip:** Avoid weekends when it's packed with Vietnamese tourists\n\n### Long Beach (Bai Truong)\n\nThe main tourist beach stretching 20km along the western coast. Most resorts are here, plus bars, restaurants, and sunset views. The water isn't as clear as Sao Beach but the sunsets are better.\n\n- **Entry:** Free\n- **Best for:** Sunset drinks, resort beaches\n- **Development:** High - this is where most tourists stay\n\n### Dinh Cau Night Market\n\nDuong Dong's evening attraction. Rows of seafood stalls where you choose your fish, crab, or lobster and they grill it on the spot. Also noodles, spring rolls, and tropical fruit.\n\n- **When:** Every evening, 5pm-10pm\n- **Budget:** **$10-20** for a seafood feast\n- **Tip:** Prices are per kilo - confirm before ordering\n\n### Hon Thom Island & Cable Car\n\nThe world's longest over-sea cable car connects Phu Quoc to Hon Thom Island, part of the Sun World amusement park. The 8km ride offers incredible views. The island has a water park and beaches.\n\n- **Cable car:** **$15-20** round trip\n- **Full park:** **$30-40** including waterpark\n- **Time needed:** Half to full day\n\n### Phu Quoc National Park\n\nCovering half the island, this protected forest has hiking trails, wildlife, and waterfalls. The infrastructure is limited - best explored with a guide or motorbike.\n\n- **Entry:** **$2**\n- **Best activity:** Motorbike through the coastal road\n- **Wildlife:** Monkeys, hornbills, and rare langurs\n\n### Snorkeling & Diving\n\nThe southern islands (An Thoi archipelago) have clear water and coral reefs. Day trips include snorkeling at multiple islands, lunch, and transport.\n\n- **Snorkeling day trip:** **$15-25**\n- **Scuba diving:** **$60-80** for two dives\n- **Best visibility:** November to April\n\n### Fishing Villages\n\nHam Ninh on the east coast is known for crab and local atmosphere. Wooden stilt houses over the water, fishing boats, and seafood restaurants serving what was caught that morning.\n\n- **Best dish:** Steamed crab with salt, pepper, and lime\n- **Getting there:** 30 minutes from Duong Dong\n\n## Where to Stay\n\n### Long Beach North (Best for Luxury)\n\nThe big resorts cluster here - JW Marriott, Intercontinental, Novotel. Private beaches, pools, spas, and high-end dining. You'll pay international resort prices but get excellent facilities.\n\n**Price range:** **$150-400/night**\n\nThis area is self-contained - you might never leave the resort, which is either perfect or boring depending on your travel style.\n\n### Long Beach South / Duong Dong (Best for Backpackers & Value)\n\nThe main town area has budget options, the night market, bars, and local life. You're close to everything but the beach isn't as nice.\n\n**Price range:** **$15-50/night**\n\nGood base for exploring the island on a budget. Rent a motorbike and access all the beaches.\n\n### Ong Lang Beach (Best Balance)\n\nQuieter than Long Beach, with boutique resorts and a more relaxed vibe. Good beach, less development, still accessible to everything.\n\n**Price range:** **$50-150/night**\n\nMy pick for couples who want nice accommodation without full resort prices.\n\n### Sao Beach Area (Best for Beach Focus)\n\nStay near the best beach if swimming and sand are your priority. Limited dining options outside resorts but beautiful setting.\n\n**Price range:** **$80-200/night**\n\n## Food and Dining\n\nPhu Quoc is famous for two things: fish sauce and fresh seafood. The island produces some of Vietnam's best nuoc mam, and the waters provide an endless supply of fish, crab, and shellfish.\n\n### Must-Try Dishes\n\n**Grilled Seafood** - The night market experience. Choose from displays of fish, squid, prawns, scallops, crab, and lobster. Grilled over coals and served with rice. **$10-25** depending on what you order.\n\n**Raw Herring Salad (Goi Ca Trich)** - Local specialty. Raw fish cured in lime with herbs, wrapped in rice paper. Sounds scary but tastes fresh and clean. **$5-8**\n\n**Ham Ninh Crab** - The east coast village specialty. Steamed crab dipped in salt, pepper, and lime. Simple and perfect. **$8-15** per kilo.\n\n**Sea Urchin** - Seasonal (April-June). Eaten raw with lime or steamed with egg. Find them at fishing village restaurants. **$3-5** each.\n\n**Bun Quay** - Phu Quoc's signature noodle soup. Fish broth, rice noodles, and a rotating selection of add-ins you choose yourself. **$2-3**\n\n### Where to Eat\n\n**Dinh Cau Night Market** - The main event. Seafood stalls galore. Arrive hungry.\n\n**Quan Dang Manh** - Local restaurant near the night market. Packed with Vietnamese diners, which says it all. **$5-10**\n\n**Crab House** - Upscale seafood restaurant for when you want proper service and AC. **$20-40**\n\n**The Pepper Tree** - International cuisine at Mango Bay Resort. Good for a non-seafood dinner. **$15-25**\n\n**Ham Ninh Fishing Village** - Multiple waterfront restaurants. Pick one and order crab.\n\n## Getting Around\n\n### Getting to Phu Quoc\n\n**By Air:** The easiest option. Phu Quoc International Airport has flights from [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city) (1 hour, **$50-100**), [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi) (2 hours, **$80-150**), and some international destinations.\n\n**By Ferry:** From Ha Tien or Rach Gia on the mainland. Superdong fast ferry takes 2.5 hours from Rach Gia (**$15**). Scenic but adds travel time.\n\n### Getting Around the Island\n\n**Motorbike:** The best way to explore. Rent for **$8-12/day**. Roads are good and traffic is light outside Duong Dong. An international driving permit is technically required.\n\n**Grab/Taxi:** Available but expensive for island distances. **$10-30** for longer trips.\n\n**Scooter Taxi (Xe Om):** Negotiate for short trips. **$2-5**.\n\n**Tour Packages:** Island tours, snorkeling trips, and sunset cruises handle transport for you. **$20-50** per day.\n\n## Budget Guide\n\n### Budget Travelers ($40-60/day)\n\nPhu Quoc isn't as cheap as mainland Vietnam, but budget travel is possible.\n\n- **Hostel/basic hotel:** **$15-25**\n- **Night market seafood:** **$10-15**\n- **Motorbike rental:** **$8-12**\n- **Beach:** Free\n- **One activity:** **$10-20** (snorkeling trip)\n\n### Mid-Range Travelers ($80-120/day)\n\n- **Nice hotel/resort:** **$50-80**\n- **Mix of seafood and restaurants:** **$20-30**\n- **Motorbike or Grab:** **$15**\n- **Cable car + beach club:** **$30-40**\n\n### Luxury Travelers ($200+/day)\n\n- **5-star resort:** **$150-300**\n- **Fine dining:** **$50-80**\n- **Private snorkeling trip:** **$100-150**\n- **Spa/massage:** **$30-60**\n\nThe JW Marriott, Intercontinental, and La Veranda offer international luxury standards.\n\n## Practical Tips\n\n### Best Time to Visit\n\n**November to March** is ideal - dry season with blue skies and calm seas. This is peak season, so book accommodation early.\n\n**April to June** is hot but still good. Shoulder season with lower prices.\n\n**July to September** is monsoon season. Rain is frequent, seas can be rough, and some beaches get seaweed. Budget travelers can find deals.\n\n### Beach Tips\n\n- **Sao Beach** is best in the morning before it gets busy\n- **Long Beach** faces west - perfect for sunset, not ideal for morning swimming\n- **Ong Lang** has rocks - wear water shoes\n- Jellyfish appear occasionally, especially in monsoon season\n\n### Money Matters\n\n- ATMs are available in Duong Dong town\n- Many resorts add service charges (5-10%)\n- Night market is cash only\n- Confirm seafood prices per kilo before ordering\n\n### Nearby Destinations\n\n| Destination | Distance | Travel Time | Direction |\n|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|\n| [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city) | 300km | 1 hour by flight | Northeast |\n| [Mekong Delta](/vietnam/destinations/mekong-delta) | 200km | 3 hours by ferry + bus | Northeast |\n| [Can Tho](/vietnam/destinations/can-tho) | 180km | Ferry + drive | Northeast |\n| Ha Tien | 45km | 1.5 hours by ferry | East |\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n- **Don't** spend all your time at your resort - the island is worth exploring\n- **Don't** skip the night market - it's the best food experience\n- **Don't** rent a motorbike if you've never ridden one - the roads are safe but still require experience\n- **Don't** expect pristine beaches everywhere - some have development or seaweed issues\n- **Don't** forget sunscreen - the tropical sun is intense\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How many days do you need in Phu Quoc?**\n\n3-4 days is ideal.
