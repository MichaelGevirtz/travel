  "content": "# Da Lat Travel Guide 2026: Cool Highlands, Waterfalls & French Villas\n\nDa Lat is Vietnam's escape from the heat. At 1,500 meters in the Central Highlands, this former French hill station offers cool pine forests, misty mornings, flower gardens, and a unique blend of European and Vietnamese architecture. It's where Vietnamese couples honeymoon and where anyone tired of tropical humidity comes to breathe.\n\nBuilt by the French as a mountain retreat in the early 1900s, Da Lat still has colonial villas, a replica Eiffel Tower, and a distinctly European feel.
