  "content": "# Vietnam 2-Week Itinerary – Spring 2026\n\nTwo weeks in Vietnam during spring? You've picked the best time. This route takes you from Hanoi's ancient streets through the limestone karsts of Ha Long Bay, then south to the imperial city of Hue and the lantern-lit lanes of Hoi An. The weather is warm but not scorching, and you'll avoid both the winter chill and summer downpours.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Duration:** 14 days / 13 nights\n- **Best Months:** March and April\n- **Regions Covered:** North Vietnam, Central Vietnam\n- **Internal Flights:** 1 (Hanoi → Hue or Da Nang)\n- **Pace:** Balanced\n- **Budget Range:** $50-100 per day\n\n## Why Spring Works\n\nMarch and April bring warm temperatures (22-28°C) across both regions. The north has shed its winter chill, and central Vietnam is dry before summer heat peaks. You'll see clear skies for Ha Long Bay cruises and comfortable walking weather in Hoi An's Old Town.\n\nThis is peak season for good reason — book accommodation and Ha Long Bay cruises at least 2 weeks ahead.\n\n## Route Overview\n\n**Entry:** Hanoi (Noi Bai Airport)\n**Exit:** Da Nang (Da Nang Airport)\n**Direction:** North → South\n\n```\nHanoi (4 nights) → Ha Long Bay (2 nights) → Hanoi (1 night) → ✈️ Hue (2 nights) → Hoi An (4 nights)\n```\n\n## Day-by-Day Itinerary\n\n### [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi) (4 nights)\n\nYour trip starts in Vietnam's capital. Spend your first two days getting lost in the Old Quarter — 36 streets named after the trades once practiced there. Visit the Temple of Literature, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, and Hoan Kiem Lake.\n\nOn day 3, take a day trip to [Ninh Binh](/vietnam/destinations/ninh-binh) (2 hours south) for the limestone karsts of Tam Coc — often called \"Ha Long Bay on land.\" Return to Hanoi for your final evening before the cruise.\n\n**Highlights:** Old Quarter, Temple of Literature, Ninh Binh day trip\n\n### [Ha Long Bay](/vietnam/destinations/ha-long-bay) (2 nights)\n\nJoin an overnight cruise through 1,600 limestone islands. Most cruises depart Hanoi around 8am, reaching the bay by noon. You'll kayak through caves, swim off the boat, and watch sunset over the karsts.\n\nA 2-night cruise lets you reach the quieter Bai Tu Long Bay area, away from day-tripper crowds. Return to Hanoi on day 7 for one night before flying south.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: 3-4 hours by shuttle (included in cruise).*\n\n**Highlights:** Overnight cruise, kayaking, Sung Sot Cave\n\n### [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue) (2 nights)\n\nFly from Hanoi to Hue (1.5 hours, $50-80). Vietnam's former imperial capital is compact and bike-friendly. Spend a full day exploring the Imperial Citadel, then visit the elaborate royal tombs along the Perfume River.\n\nThe Thien Mu Pagoda at sunset is worth the short ride from town.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: 1.5-hour flight, $50-80.*\n\n**Highlights:** Imperial Citadel, Royal Tombs, Thien Mu Pagoda\n\n### [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an) (4 nights)\n\nDrive or take the scenic train along the coast to Hoi An (3-4 hours). This UNESCO town of lantern-lit streets and tailor shops deserves unhurried exploration.\n\nSpend mornings at An Bang Beach, afternoons wandering the Old Town, and evenings eating your way through the night market. Take a half-day trip to the My Son ruins or a cooking class.\n\nUse [Da Nang](/vietnam/destinations/da-nang) airport for your departure — it's just 30 minutes away.\n\n*Travel from Hue: 3-4 hours by car or train (Hai Van Pass route recommended).*\n\n**Highlights:** Old Town, An Bang Beach, tailoring, cooking class\n\n## Why This Itinerary Works\n\n**Weather:** Spring means 24-28°C temperatures with minimal rain. Ha Long Bay has clear skies for cruising, and Hoi An is warm but not yet sweltering.\n\n**Distances:** One flight (Hanoi → Hue) keeps travel efficient. The Hue to Hoi An drive along the Hai Van Pass is scenic, not exhausting.\n\n**Pacing:** 4 nights in Hanoi and 4 in Hoi An give you proper bases. No single-night hotel changes.\n\n## Adjustments\n\n**Shorter trip (10-12 days):** Cut Hue to 1 night or skip it entirely — fly direct to Da Nang and add nights in Hoi An.\n\n**Slower pace:** Add a night in Ninh Binh instead of day-tripping, or extend Ha Long Bay to 3 nights.\n\n**Bad weather backup:** If rain hits Ha Long Bay, the cruise still operates — just less swimming. Caves and karst views remain impressive.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is 2 weeks enough for Vietnam?**\n\nYes. A 2-week Vietnam trip covers 2 regions comfortably, with time for both cities and nature. You'll see the highlights of North and Central Vietnam without rushing.\n\n**Should I fly or train from Hanoi to Hue?**\n\nFly. The train takes 13-14 hours overnight. The flight is 1.5 hours and costs $50-80. Save your energy for exploring.\n\n**Can I do this itinerary in reverse?**\n\nAbsolutely. Fly into Da Nang, start in Hoi An, and work north. The weather is equally good in either direction during spring.\n\n**What about Sapa or Phu Quoc?**\n\nSapa adds 2-3 days in the north. Phu Quoc requires flying south — better saved for a 3-week trip.
