  "content": "# Vietnam 3-Week Itinerary – Spring 2026\n\nThree weeks in Vietnam during spring is the trip of a lifetime. You'll travel from Hanoi's ancient streets to the beaches of Phu Quoc, covering all three regions with perfect weather the entire way. Spring's balanced conditions mean every destination is at its best.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Duration:** 21 days / 20 nights\n- **Best Months:** March and April\n- **Regions Covered:** North, Central, South Vietnam\n- **Internal Flights:** 2 (Hanoi → Da Nang, HCMC → Phu Quoc)\n- **Pace:** Relaxed\n- **Budget Range:** $50-100 per day\n\n## Why Spring Works\n\nSpring is Vietnam's best overall season. The north has shed its winter chill (22-28°C), central Vietnam is dry and warm, and the south hasn't hit full summer heat yet. You can comfortably visit any part of the country without weather compromises.\n\nThis is peak tourism season — book accommodation and Ha Long Bay cruises 3-4 weeks ahead.\n\n## Route Overview\n\n**Entry:** Hanoi (Noi Bai Airport)\n**Exit:** Phu Quoc (Phu Quoc Airport)\n**Direction:** North → Central → South\n\n```\nHanoi (3 nights) → Ha Long Bay (2 nights) → Ninh Binh (2 nights) → ✈️ Hue (2 nights) → Hoi An (4 nights) → ✈️ HCMC (3 nights) → Phu Quoc (4 nights)\n```\n\n## Day-by-Day Itinerary\n\n### [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi) (3 nights)\n\nStart in Vietnam's ancient capital. Three nights gives you time to properly explore — the Old Quarter's 36 streets, Hoan Kiem Lake, Temple of Literature, and Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. Spring weather is perfect for walking: warm days, cool evenings.\n\nDon't rush the food scene: pho, bun cha, banh mi, egg coffee. Hanoi rewards slow exploration.\n\n**Highlights:** Old Quarter, Temple of Literature, street food, egg coffee\n\n### [Ha Long Bay](/vietnam/destinations/ha-long-bay) (2 nights)\n\nJoin a 2-night cruise through 1,600 limestone karsts. Spring brings clear skies and calm seas — ideal conditions for kayaking, swimming, and sunset drinks on deck. The longer cruise reaches Bai Tu Long Bay's quieter waters.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: 3-4 hours by shuttle (included in cruise).*\n\n**Highlights:** Overnight cruise, kayaking, caves, sunrise over karsts\n\n### [Ninh Binh](/vietnam/destinations/ninh-binh) (2 nights)\n\nReturn toward Hanoi, then continue south to Ninh Binh (4 hours total). The limestone karsts rising from rice paddies are often called \"Ha Long Bay on land\" — and spring's green paddies make them stunning.\n\nRow through Tam Coc's caves, climb Mua Cave for panoramic views, and cycle the quiet roads around Trang An.\n\n*Travel from Ha Long Bay: 4 hours by car.*\n\n**Highlights:** Tam Coc, Mua Cave viewpoint, cycling\n\n### [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue) (2 nights)\n\nFly from Hanoi to Hue (1.5 hours). Vietnam's former imperial capital is compact and bike-friendly. Explore the massive Citadel, visit the elaborate royal tombs along the Perfume River, and catch sunset at Thien Mu Pagoda.\n\n*Travel from Ninh Binh: Return to Hanoi (2 hours), then 1.5-hour flight to Hue.*\n\n**Highlights:** Imperial Citadel, Royal Tombs, Thien Mu Pagoda\n\n### [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an) (4 nights)\n\nTake the scenic drive to Hoi An via the Hai Van Pass (3-4 hours). Four nights in this UNESCO town lets you truly settle in — mornings at An Bang Beach, afternoons with tailors, evenings in the lantern-lit Old Town.\n\nTake a cooking class, day trip to My Son ruins, or simply wander. Hoi An rewards those who stay.\n\n*Travel from Hue: 3-4 hours by car (Hai Van Pass route).*\n\n**Highlights:** Old Town, tailoring, An Bang Beach, cooking class\n\n### [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city) (3 nights)\n\nFly from Da Nang to HCMC (1.5 hours). Vietnam's largest city is modern, chaotic, and endlessly energetic — a stark contrast to the ancient towns you've been visiting.\n\nThe War Remnants Museum is essential. Explore Chinatown, the Ben Thanh Market area, and the rooftop bar scene. Day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels or the Mekong Delta.\n\n*Travel from Hoi An: 45-minute transfer to Da Nang, 1.5-hour flight to HCMC.*\n\n**Highlights:** War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi Tunnels, rooftop bars, street food\n\n### [Phu Quoc](/vietnam/destinations/phu-quoc) (4 nights)\n\nFly to Phu Quoc (1 hour) for four nights of beach finale. White sand, clear water, excellent seafood — the perfect way to end three weeks of travel.\n\nRent a motorbike to explore the island. Evenings at the Duong Dong night market. Just decompress.\n\n*Travel from HCMC: 1-hour flight, $40-80.*\n\n**Highlights:** Beaches, seafood, sunsets, island exploring\n\n## Why This Itinerary Works\n\n**Complete coverage:** Three weeks lets you experience all three regions properly — not rushing through any.\n\n**Perfect weather:** Spring means comfortable conditions everywhere. No typhoons, no freezing mountains, no unbearable heat.\n\n**Logical flow:** North → Central → South follows a natural progression. Two flights keep it efficient.\n\n## Adjustments\n\n**Add Sapa:** Replace Ninh Binh with Sapa (3 nights) for mountain trekking. Take the overnight train from Hanoi.\n\n**More Mekong:** Add 2 nights in Can Tho between HCMC and Phu Quoc for floating markets.\n\n**Different beaches:** Replace Phu Quoc with [Con Dao](/vietnam/destinations/con-dao) for better snorkeling and fewer tourists.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is 3 weeks too long for Vietnam?**\n\nNo — it's ideal. Three weeks lets you cover all regions at a relaxed pace with time to actually experience each place, not just tick boxes.\n\n**How much will this trip cost?**\n\nBudget $1,000-2,000 total for accommodation, food, transport, and activities. Add $300-400 for international flights. Mid-range travelers spend $60-80/day.\n\n**What's the best direction — north to south or reverse?**\n\nBoth work equally well in spring. North to south is traditional; south to north lets you end in Hanoi's food scene rather than beaches.\n\n**Can I do this route faster?**\n\nYes, but it becomes a 2-week rush. If you have less time, focus on 2 regions instead of cramming all three.",
