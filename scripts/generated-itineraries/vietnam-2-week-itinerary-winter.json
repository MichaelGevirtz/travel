  "content": "# Vietnam 2-Week Itinerary – Winter 2026\n\nWinter is South Vietnam's peak season — dry, warm, and perfect for beaches. This 14-day route combines Central Vietnam's culture (Hoi An and Hue) with the south's energy and islands. You'll trade cold weather for 28-32°C sunshine while the north shivers in fog.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Duration:** 14 days / 13 nights\n- **Best Months:** December through February\n- **Regions Covered:** Central Vietnam, South Vietnam\n- **Internal Flights:** 2 (Hanoi → Da Nang, HCMC → Phu Quoc)\n- **Pace:** Relaxed\n- **Budget Range:** $55-110 per day\n\n## Why Winter Works\n\nDecember-February is the south's dry season — sunshine, low humidity, and virtually no rain. Central Vietnam has mild temperatures (20-25°C) and occasional drizzle but nothing like autumn's typhoons. Meanwhile, North Vietnam is 10-15°C, gray, and foggy.\n\nThis is peak season for Phu Quoc and Hoi An — book accommodation 3-4 weeks ahead.\n\n## Day-by-Day Itinerary\n\n### [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an) (4 nights)\n\nFly into Da Nang and transfer to Hoi An (45 minutes). Winter in Hoi An is mild — 20-25°C, occasional light rain, but nothing that stops exploration.\n\nSpend days wandering the lantern-lit Old Town, getting clothes tailored (budget 2-3 days for fittings), and cycling to the beach. Take a cooking class, visit the My Son Cham ruins, and eat your way through the food scene — cao lau, banh mi, white rose dumplings.\n\nFour nights lets you settle in without rushing.\n\n**Highlights:** Old Town, tailoring, An Bang Beach, cooking class\n\n### [Hue](/vietnam/destinations/hue) (2 nights)\n\nTake the scenic drive north to Hue (3-4 hours via Hai Van Pass) — one of Vietnam's best road trips. Hue is Vietnam's former imperial capital, with the massive Citadel, ornate royal tombs, and the Perfume River.\n\nWinter weather is cool and occasionally drizzly, but the Citadel is less crowded and the atmosphere is contemplative. Visit the Thien Mu Pagoda at sunset.\n\n*Travel from Hoi An: 3-4 hours by car or train (Hai Van Pass route recommended).*\n\n**Highlights:** Imperial Citadel, Royal Tombs, Thien Mu Pagoda\n\n### [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city) (3 nights)\n\nFly from Hue (or Da Nang) to HCMC (1.5 hours). Vietnam's largest city hums with a different energy than the ancient towns you've been in — modern, fast, chaotic.\n\nThe War Remnants Museum provides essential historical context. Explore the French colonial architecture, the Ben Thanh Market area, and Chinatown (Cho Lon). Day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels or the Mekong Delta.\n\nWinter HCMC is warm (28-32°C) and dry — perfect walking weather.\n\n*Travel from Hue: 1.5-hour flight via Da Nang, $50-80.*\n\n**Highlights:** War Remnants Museum, rooftop bars, Cu Chi Tunnels, food scene\n\n### [Phu Quoc](/vietnam/destinations/phu-quoc) (4 nights)\n\nFly to Phu Quoc (1 hour) for four nights of beach unwinding. Vietnam's largest island has white sand, clear water, and excellent seafood — the perfect finale to your trip.\n\nAlternate between Long Beach and the quieter Sao Beach. Rent a motorbike to explore fishing villages and pepper farms. Evenings: the Duong Dong night market for grilled seafood at local prices.\n\nWinter is Phu Quoc's peak season — book ahead for good rates.\n\n*Travel from HCMC: 1-hour flight, $40-80.*\n\n**Highlights:** Beaches, seafood, island exploring, sunsets\n\n## Why This Itinerary Works\n\n**Weather match:** Central Vietnam is comfortable in winter (no typhoons), and the south is at its dry-season best. North Vietnam would be cold and gray.\n\n**Beach finale:** End with 4 nights on Phu Quoc — the best way to decompress before flying home.\n\n**Cultural depth:** Hoi An and Hue provide history and charm before HCMC's urban energy.\n\n## Adjustments\n\n**Skip Hue:** Fly direct from Da Nang to HCMC, add nights in Hoi An or Phu Quoc.\n\n**Add Mekong Delta:** Replace one HCMC night with 2 nights in Can Tho for floating markets and river life.\n\n**Different island:** Replace Phu Quoc with [Con Dao](/vietnam/destinations/con-dao) for fewer tourists and better snorkeling. Flights run daily from HCMC.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What's the weather like in Hoi An in winter?**\n\nMild — 20-25°C with occasional light rain. Pack a light jacket for evenings and a small umbrella. It's not the sunny beach weather of summer, but it's comfortable for exploring.\n\n**Is the north worth skipping in winter?**\n\nFor most travelers, yes. Hanoi is 10-15°C and gray. Ha Long Bay cruises run but visibility is poor. Sapa can be freezing with zero views. If you want guaranteed good weather, stay south.\n\n**Why Phu Quoc over other beaches?**\n\nEasiest flights from HCMC, best infrastructure, long sandy beaches. For quieter options, try [Con Dao](/vietnam/destinations/con-dao) or [Mui Ne](/vietnam/destinations/mui-ne).\n\n**Can I start in the south and go north?**\n\nYes — fly into Phu Quoc, end in Da Nang. The weather works the same in either direction.",
