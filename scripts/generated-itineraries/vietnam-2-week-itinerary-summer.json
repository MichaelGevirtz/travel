  "content": "# Vietnam 2-Week Itinerary – Summer 2026\n\nSummer in Vietnam means heat — but two weeks gives you time to find the cool spots. This route pairs North Vietnam's mountains (where Sapa sits at a pleasant 20-25°C) with Ha Long Bay's breezes and ends at the beaches of Central Vietnam. You'll escape the worst of the humidity while seeing the country's highlights.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Duration:** 14 days / 13 nights\n- **Best Months:** May through August\n- **Regions Covered:** North Vietnam, Central Vietnam\n- **Internal Flights:** 1 (Hanoi → Da Nang)\n- **Pace:** Balanced\n- **Budget Range:** $50-100 per day\n\n## Why Summer Works\n\nSummer's afternoon rains are predictable — plan outdoor activities for morning. The mountains stay cool (Sapa: 20-25°C vs. Hanoi's 35°C), rice terraces glow green, and waterfalls run full. Central Vietnam's beaches are warm but swimmable, and the sea is calm.\n\nExpect brief rain showers (usually 2-4pm), but mornings and evenings are clear.\n\n## Day-by-Day Itinerary\n\n### [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi) (2 nights)\n\nArrive and embrace Hanoi's summer rhythm — early mornings, midday rest, evening exploration. The Old Quarter's narrow streets provide shade, and iced coffee culture makes perfect sense now. Visit Hoan Kiem Lake at dawn, the Temple of Literature in late afternoon.\n\nSummer evenings are warm enough for rooftop drinks and extended street food sessions.\n\n**Highlights:** Old Quarter, Temple of Literature, iced coffee culture\n\n### [Sapa](/vietnam/destinations/sapa) (3 nights)\n\nEscape the heat on the overnight train to Sapa (8 hours). At 1,500m elevation, temperatures drop to 20-25°C — jacket weather compared to Hanoi's swelter.\n\nSummer is rice-growing season. The terraces are flooded and bright green — the most photogenic time of year. Trek to Cat Cat Village, through terraces to Ta Van, and up to Ta Phin. Afternoon rains make waterproof gear essential, but mornings are clear.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: Overnight train (8 hours, $35-50) or bus (5-6 hours, $15-25).*\n\n**Highlights:** Cool mountain air, green rice terraces, hill tribe villages\n\n### Hanoi (1 night)\n\nReturn to Hanoi on the day bus (mountain scenery) or overnight train. One night here before Ha Long Bay — catch anything you missed or revisit favorite spots.\n\n### [Ha Long Bay](/vietnam/destinations/ha-long-bay) (2 nights)\n\nJoin a 2-night cruise through 1,600 limestone islands. Summer brings calm seas and warm water for swimming. Afternoon rain rarely disrupts cruises — you'll be kayaking in caves or relaxing on deck.\n\nThe longer cruise reaches Bai Tu Long Bay, away from day-tripper crowds. Return to Hanoi on day 9 for your flight south.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: 3-4 hours by shuttle (included in cruise).*\n\n**Highlights:** Overnight cruise, kayaking, swimming, caves\n\n### [Hoi An](/vietnam/destinations/hoi-an) (4 nights)\n\nFly from Hanoi to Da Nang (1.5 hours), then transfer to Hoi An (45 minutes). The ancient town is hot in summer but manageable — mornings at An Bang Beach, afternoons exploring air-conditioned tailor shops, evenings in the lantern-lit Old Town.\n\nTake a cooking class, day trip to the My Son ruins, or just alternate between beach and town. The sea is calm and warm — perfect swimming conditions.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: 1.5-hour flight to Da Nang ($50-80), then 45-minute transfer.*\n\n**Highlights:** An Bang Beach, Old Town, tailoring, cooking class\n\n## Why This Itinerary Works\n\n**Heat escape:** Sapa's elevation keeps you cool during the hottest days. Ha Long Bay's breezes and Hoi An's beaches provide natural air conditioning.\n\n**Green terraces:** Summer is rice-growing season — Sapa's terraces are bright green versus autumn's gold or winter's brown.\n\n**Predictable rain:** Showers are brief (2-4pm). Plan treks and tours for morning, relax during rain, explore again at dusk.\n\n## Adjustments\n\n**More beach:** Extend Hoi An to 5-6 nights or add [Da Nang](/vietnam/destinations/da-nang) for resort beaches.\n\n**Skip Sapa:** Replace with [Ninh Binh](/vietnam/destinations/ninh-binh) (2 nights) if you prefer karst landscapes over mountain trekking. It's hot but manageable with early starts.\n\n**If rain is heavy:** Sapa treks still run but visibility drops. Focus on village visits and Fansipan cable car instead of viewpoint hikes.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is summer too hot for Vietnam?**\n\nFor Hanoi and lowlands, yes it's hot (33-36°C). But this route includes Sapa (cool), Ha Long Bay (breezy), and beaches (swimmable). You'll manage fine with early starts.\n\n**What about Central Vietnam in summer?**\n\nHoi An and Da Nang are hot but have beaches for cooling off. It's not typhoon season yet (that's autumn). The dry heat is more pleasant than Hanoi's humidity.\n\n**Should I pack rain gear?**\n\nYes — a light rain jacket is essential for Sapa treks. Afternoon showers are almost daily but brief. Quick-dry clothing helps.\n\n**Can I reverse this route?**\n\nYes, fly into Da Nang, start in Hoi An, and work north. You'll end with Sapa's cool mountains after the beach heat.",
