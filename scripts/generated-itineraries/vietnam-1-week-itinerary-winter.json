  "content": "# Vietnam 1-Week Itinerary – Winter 2026\n\nWhile North Vietnam shivers and mountain roads fog over, the south basks in dry-season perfection. This 7-day winter route combines Ho Chi Minh City's energy, the Mekong Delta's river life, and Phu Quoc's beaches — all with 28-32°C sunshine and minimal rain.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Duration:** 7 days / 6 nights\n- **Best Months:** December through February\n- **Region:** South Vietnam only\n- **Internal Flights:** 1 (HCMC → Phu Quoc)\n- **Pace:** Relaxed\n- **Budget Range:** $50-100 per day\n\n## Why Winter Works\n\nDecember through February is South Vietnam's dry season — sunny days, low humidity, and virtually no rain. It's the best time for Phu Quoc's beaches and comfortable for exploring HCMC's streets. Meanwhile, the north is cold (10-15°C in Hanoi) with gray skies.\n\n## Route Overview\n\n**Entry:** Ho Chi Minh City (Tan Son Nhat Airport)\n**Exit:** Phu Quoc (Phu Quoc Airport)\n**Direction:** HCMC → Delta → Beach\n\n```\nHo Chi Minh City (2 nights) → Mekong Delta (2 nights) → ✈️ Phu Quoc (2 nights)\n```\n\n## Day-by-Day Itinerary\n\n### [Ho Chi Minh City](/vietnam/destinations/ho-chi-minh-city) (2 nights)\n\nVietnam's largest city runs on a different energy than Hanoi — faster, louder, more modern. Start at the War Remnants Museum for essential Vietnam War history, then wander the French colonial architecture around Notre Dame Cathedral and the Central Post Office.\n\nDay two: explore Cho Lon (Chinatown), the Ben Thanh Market area, and the rooftop bars of District 1. HCMC's food scene rivals Hanoi's — don't miss banh mi, com tam (broken rice), and pho served with fresh herbs.\n\n**Highlights:** War Remnants Museum, Ben Thanh Market, rooftop bars, street food\n\n### [Mekong Delta](/vietnam/destinations/mekong-delta) (2 nights)\n\nHead southwest into the Mekong Delta — Vietnam's rice bowl and a world of rivers, canals, and floating markets. Base yourself in Can Tho (3.5 hours from HCMC) for the best access.\n\nWake before dawn to visit Cai Rang Floating Market, where boats trade produce from 5-8am. Spend afternoons on sampan rides through coconut palm-lined canals, visiting fruit orchards and local workshops. A homestay on the river adds authenticity.\n\nWinter's dry season means calm waters and easy boat travel.\n\n*Travel from HCMC: 3.5 hours by bus or private car, $10-50.*\n\n**Highlights:** Cai Rang Floating Market, sampan rides, river homestay\n\n### [Phu Quoc](/vietnam/destinations/phu-quoc) (2 nights)\n\nReturn to HCMC (or Can Tho) for a short flight to Phu Quoc (1 hour from HCMC, 45 min from Can Tho). Vietnam's largest island has the beaches the south is famous for — white sand, clear water, and excellent seafood.\n\nSpend your days between Long Beach and Sao Beach. Rent a motorbike to explore the island's fishing villages and pepper farms. The night market in Duong Dong town serves fresh-grilled seafood at local prices.\n\nWinter is Phu Quoc's peak season — book accommodation ahead.\n\n*Travel from Can Tho/HCMC: 45-60 minute flight, $40-80.*\n\n**Highlights:** Beaches, seafood, island exploring, sunset views\n\n## Why This Itinerary Works\n\n**Weather:** South Vietnam's dry season means 28-32°C, sunshine, and almost no rain. Perfect for both city exploring and beach time.\n\n**Variety:** This route mixes urban energy (HCMC), rural river life (Mekong), and beach relaxation (Phu Quoc) — three distinct experiences in one week.\n\n**Avoiding the cold:** The north is 10-15°C with gray skies in winter. Mountains can be foggy for weeks. Stay south.\n\n## Adjustments\n\n**More beach:** Skip the Mekong and fly direct to Phu Quoc for 4 nights of beach time.\n\n**Different island:** Replace Phu Quoc with [Con Dao](/vietnam/destinations/con-dao) for fewer tourists and better snorkeling. Flights or fast ferries run from HCMC.\n\n**Add Da Lat:** The mountain town of [Da Lat](/vietnam/destinations/da-lat) has cooler weather (15-20°C) and French colonial charm. Add 2 nights between HCMC and the delta.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is winter a good time for South Vietnam?**\n\nIt's the best time. December-February is dry season — expect sunshine, warm temperatures, and perfect beach weather. Book ahead for Phu Quoc.\n\n**Can I fly into Phu Quoc directly?**\n\nYes, Phu Quoc has an international airport with direct flights from several Asian cities. But starting in HCMC lets you experience the contrast between city, delta, and beach.\n\n**What about the Mekong Delta in the dry season?**\n\nExcellent. Water levels are lower but boat tours run smoothly. Floating markets operate year-round. Less rain means easier travel between villages.\n\n**Should I visit Hanoi in winter?**\n\nOnly if you don't mind cold and gray. Hanoi in January averages 15°C with drizzle and fog. Ha Long Bay cruises still run but views suffer. Sapa can be freezing. The south is far more pleasant.",
