  "content": "# Vietnam 1-Week Itinerary – Spring 2026\n\nOne week in Vietnam is enough to fall in love with the country. This spring route focuses on North Vietnam — Hanoi's Old Quarter, an overnight cruise through Ha Long Bay's limestone karsts, and the \"Ha Long Bay on land\" landscapes of Ninh Binh. You'll experience the best of the north without rushing.\n\n## Quick Facts\n\n- **Duration:** 7 days / 6 nights\n- **Best Months:** March and April\n- **Region:** North Vietnam only\n- **Internal Flights:** 0\n- **Pace:** Relaxed\n- **Budget Range:** $40-80 per day\n\n## Why Spring Works\n\nSpring brings the north's best weather — warm days (22-26°C), minimal rain, and clear skies for Ha Long Bay cruises. The winter chill has lifted but summer humidity hasn't arrived. Perfect conditions for both city walking and outdoor activities.\n\n## Route Overview\n\n**Entry/Exit:** Hanoi (Noi Bai Airport)\n**Direction:** Loop from Hanoi\n\n```\nHanoi (2 nights) → Ninh Binh (2 nights) → Ha Long Bay (2 nights) → Hanoi (fly out)\n```\n\n## Day-by-Day Itinerary\n\n### [Hanoi](/vietnam/destinations/hanoi) (2 nights)\n\nArrive and dive into Vietnam's ancient capital. Day one: wander the Old Quarter's 36 streets, visit Hoan Kiem Lake, and try your first bowl of pho. Day two: explore the Temple of Literature, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum complex, and the chaotic-but-charming Train Street.\n\nEvenings are for street food — bun cha, banh mi, egg coffee. The Old Quarter comes alive after dark.\n\n**Highlights:** Old Quarter, Temple of Literature, street food\n\n### [Ninh Binh](/vietnam/destinations/ninh-binh) (2 nights)\n\nHead south to Ninh Binh (2 hours by bus or car). This region of limestone karsts, rice paddies, and winding rivers is often called \"Ha Long Bay on land\" — and it's less crowded.\n\nTake a sampan boat through Tam Coc's caves, cycle through rice fields to Mua Cave for panoramic views, and visit the ancient capital of Hoa Lu. The pace here is slow and rural — a contrast to Hanoi's energy.\n\n*Travel from Hanoi: 2 hours by bus or private car, $8-15.*\n\n**Highlights:** Tam Coc boat ride, Mua Cave viewpoint, cycling\n\n### [Ha Long Bay](/vietnam/destinations/ha-long-bay) (2 nights)\n\nReturn toward Hanoi, then continue east to Ha Long Bay (3-4 hours total from Ninh Binh). Board an overnight cruise through 1,600 limestone islands — kayaking, swimming, cave visits, and sunset drinks on deck.\n\nA 2-night cruise reaches the quieter Bai Tu Long area, away from day-tripper crowds. You'll return to Hanoi on day 7 for your flight home.\n\n*Travel from Ninh Binh: 3-4 hours by car (cruise pickup often included).*\n\n**Highlights:** Overnight cruise, kayaking, Sung Sot Cave\n\n## Why This Itinerary Works\n\n**Weather:** Spring means clear skies and 22-26°C temperatures. Ha Long Bay cruises run smoothly, and Ninh Binh's karsts are sharp against blue skies.\n\n**Distances:** Everything is within 2-4 hours of Hanoi. No flights needed, no exhausting travel days.\n\n**Pacing:** Two nights at each stop gives you full days to enjoy each place without rushing.\n\n## Adjustments\n\n**Shorter trip (5 days):** Skip Ninh Binh and do Hanoi (2 nights) + Ha Long Bay (2 nights).\n\n**More adventure:** Replace Ninh Binh with [Cat Ba Island](/vietnam/destinations/cat-ba) for hiking and less-touristy bay access.\n\n**Bad weather:** If rain hits Ha Long Bay, cruises still operate. Caves and karsts remain impressive — just less swimming.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is 1 week enough for Vietnam?**\n\nFor one region, yes. A 7-day trip covers North Vietnam comfortably — Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, and Ninh Binh. For multiple regions, you'll need 2+ weeks.\n\n**Should I book Ha Long Bay in advance?**\n\nYes, especially in spring (peak season). Book your cruise 2-3 weeks ahead for the best boats and prices. Budget $150-300 for a quality 2-night cruise.\n\n**Can I add Sapa to this trip?**\n\nIt's tight. Sapa needs 2-3 days minimum and is 5-6 hours from Hanoi. Better saved for a 10-day trip or a separate visit.\n\n**What's the best way to get to Ninh Binh?**\n\nPrivate car ($50-60) is most convenient. Buses run frequently ($8-10) but take longer. The train is scenic but the station is far from town.",
