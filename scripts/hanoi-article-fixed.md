# Hanoi Travel Guide 2025: Everything You Need to Know

Planning a trip to Hanoi? You're in for a treat. Vietnam's capital is a wild mix of old and new - ancient temples sit next to French colonial buildings, while motorbikes zip through streets filled with food vendors.

This guide covers everything you need to know to plan your visit, from where to stay to what to eat. Let's dive in.

## Why Visit Hanoi

Hanoi is where you'll find the real Vietnam. Unlike [Ho Chi Minh City](/ho-chi-minh-city) down south, which feels more modern and fast-paced, Hanoi holds onto its traditions.

You'll see grandmothers selling soup on street corners at 6am. Men play chess in the park. Families gather for coffee at tiny sidewalk cafes.

### Perfect for Every Traveler

The city works for every type of visitor. Backpackers love the cheap hostels and street food scene in the Old Quarter. Couples enjoy romantic walks around Hoan Kiem Lake and fancy French restaurants.

History buffs spend days visiting museums and temples. Families find parks, water puppet shows, and kid-friendly activities.

### Layers of History

What makes Hanoi special is how layers of history sit side by side. You'll eat pho for breakfast in a 100-year-old shop, walk past French villas from the 1920s, visit temples built in the 11th century, and end your day at a rooftop bar overlooking it all.

The city doesn't try to hide its past - it celebrates it.

### The Food Scene

The food alone is worth the trip. Hanoi is the birthplace of pho, bun cha (Obama ate here in 2016), and egg coffee. You'll find better street food here than anywhere else in Vietnam.

Most dishes cost **$1-3**, and the quality is incredible.

### Know Before You Go

One warning: Hanoi is chaotic. Crossing the street takes courage. The noise never stops. The humidity in summer is brutal.

But that's part of the appeal. Give yourself a few days to adjust, and you'll start to love the organized chaos.

## Top Attractions

### Hoan Kiem Lake and Ngoc Son Temple

This lake sits right in the city center and is where locals come to exercise, socialize, and relax. Walk around it early morning (5-7am) to see tai chi classes and morning joggers.

The temple on the island costs **$1** to enter and takes 20 minutes to see. Legend says a giant turtle lives in the lake - you might spot one if you're lucky.

The area gets crowded on weekends when the streets close to traffic.

### Old Quarter (36 Streets)

This is Hanoi's beating heart. Each street used to sell one product (Silk Street, Silver Street, etc.), and some still do.

Spend half a day wandering the narrow lanes, dodging motorbikes, and stopping for coffee or snacks. The architecture is amazing - skinny tube houses with colorful facades.

Go early morning or late afternoon to avoid the worst heat and traffic. Don't miss Dong Xuan Market at the north end.

### Temple of Literature

Vietnam's first university, built in 1070. The gardens are peaceful, perfect for escaping the city noise.

**Entry:** $2 | **Time needed:** 1-2 hours

The stone tablets listing doctoral graduates from centuries ago are fascinating. Arrive when it opens (8am) to beat the tour groups.

The temple hosts traditional music performances some afternoons - check the schedule at the entrance.

### Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum Complex

Love him or hate him, Uncle Ho is everywhere in Vietnam. His preserved body lies in this massive mausoleum.

**Entry:** Free (closed Mondays and Fridays)

You'll need to dress modestly (covered shoulders and knees) and can't bring bags or cameras inside. The viewing takes 5 minutes - you walk past in silence.

The surrounding complex includes his house on stilts, the Presidential Palace, and One Pillar Pagoda. Budget 2-3 hours for everything.

### Hoa Lo Prison (Hanoi Hilton)

This French colonial prison held Vietnamese revolutionaries and later American POWs during the Vietnam War. **Entry is $1.50** and it takes about an hour.

The exhibits are heavy but important for understanding Vietnam's history. John McCain's flight suit is on display.

Some sections show the harsh conditions prisoners faced. Not suitable for young kids.

### Train Street

A narrow residential street where trains pass twice daily, just inches from people's homes. It's touristy now but still worth seeing.

Cafes line the tracks where you can grab a coffee and wait for the train (around **3:30pm and 7:30pm**). The government keeps threatening to close it, so visit while you can.

Get there 30 minutes early for a good spot.

### West Lake (Ho Tay)

Hanoi's biggest lake, popular with expats and wealthy locals. Rent a bike and cycle the 17km loop, stopping at Tran Quoc Pagoda (the oldest in Hanoi) and cafes along the way.

The area has great restaurants and breweries. Less touristy than the Old Quarter but still interesting.

Good for a half-day trip when you need a break from the chaos.

## Where to Stay

### Old Quarter (Best for First-Timers)

This is where most backpackers and budget travelers stay. You're walking distance to everything, surrounded by street food, and in the thick of Hanoi's energy.

**Price range:** Dorm beds $5-8, private rooms $15-25

The downside? It's loud. Motorbikes honk all night, and you'll hear everything from neighboring rooms.

Check out Hanoi Backpackers Hostel for the party scene or Little Charm Hanoi for something quieter. If you're a light sleeper, request a room facing away from the main street.

### French Quarter (Best for Comfort)

South of Hoan Kiem Lake, this area has wider streets, colonial villas, and upscale hotels. It's quieter than the Old Quarter but still central.

**Price range:** Boutique hotels $40-80/night, luxury hotels $200+/night

You'll find boutique hotels, cafes, and restaurants. The Sofitel Legend Metropole is here if you want to splurge.

This area works well for couples or anyone wanting comfort without sacrificing location. Walking to the Old Quarter takes 10-15 minutes.

### West Lake Area (Best for Long Stays)

If you're staying more than a week or want to live like a local, consider West Lake. It's where expats live, so you'll find international restaurants, gyms, and quieter streets.

**Price range:** Hotels and Airbnbs $30-60/night

You're 20-30 minutes from the Old Quarter by taxi (**$3-5**). This area makes sense if you're working remotely or want a break from tourist central.

The sunset views over the lake are beautiful.

### Tay Ho (Best for Foodies)

The neighborhood around West Lake's eastern shore is packed with Vietnamese restaurants, craft breweries, and cafes. It's popular with young Vietnamese and expats.

**Price range:** $25-50/night for decent hotels

You'll need to taxi or Grab into the city center (**$2-4**), but the food scene makes it worthwhile. Stay here if you're serious about eating your way through Hanoi.

## Food and Dining

### Pho (Noodle Soup)

You can't leave Hanoi without trying pho. The best bowls are at tiny shops with plastic stools, not fancy restaurants.

**Top spots:**
- Pho Gia Truyen (49 Bat Dan Street) - **$2** for incredible beef pho
- Pho Thin (13 Lo Duc Street) - different style with stir-fried beef - **$1.50-3**

Go early (7-9am) before they sell out.

### Bun Cha (Grilled Pork with Noodles)

This is Hanoi's signature dish. You get grilled pork patties and pork belly in a sweet-sour broth, plus cold noodles and herbs on the side.

Mix it all together.

**Top spots:**
- Bun Cha Huong Lien (24 Le Van Huu) - where Obama ate - **$3.50**
- Hang Buom Street vendors - **$1.50-2.50**

### Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich)

French baguettes filled with pate, meat, pickled vegetables, and herbs. Banh Mi 25 (25 Hang Ca Street) is legendary - expect a line but it moves fast.

**Price:** $1 per sandwich

They're best fresh in the morning. Vegetarian versions are easy to find - just say "chay" (vegetarian).

### Egg Coffee (Ca Phe Trung)

Whipped egg yolk mixed with condensed milk and coffee creates a dessert-like drink. Cafe Giang (39 Nguyen Huu Huan) invented it in the 1940s and still serves the best version.

**Price:** $1.50

The cafe is hidden down an alley - look for the small sign. Sit upstairs for a better view. It's sweet and rich, perfect for an afternoon pick-me-up.

Cafe Pho Co (11 Hang Gai) also serves great egg coffee with amazing lake views from its hidden upstairs location.

### More Must-Try Dishes

**Cha Ca (Turmeric Fish)**
Grilled fish with turmeric, dill, and peanuts, served sizzling at your table. Cha Ca Thang Long (21-31 Duong Thanh) specializes in this dish. **$8-10 per person** - pricier than street food but worth trying once.

**Bun Bo Nam Bo (Beef Noodle Salad)**
Cold rice noodles with marinated beef, peanuts, herbs, and fish sauce dressing. Refreshing on hot days. Bun Bo Nam Bo (67 Hang Dieu) is the most famous spot. **$2.50** - huge portions.

### Where to Eat

The best street food areas are in the Old Quarter:
- Bat Dan Street - multiple pho shops
- Hang Manh Street - banh cuon (steamed rice rolls)
- Walk around 6-8am or 5-7pm when vendors set up

Point at what looks good and sit down.

**Sit-Down Restaurants:**
- Highway4 (multiple locations) - northern Vietnamese food, mains **$5-8**
- Quan An Ngon (18 Phan Boi Chau) - street food in restaurant setting, **$3-6**

### Vegetarian Options

Hanoi has tons of vegetarian food. Look for "com chay" or "an chay" signs.

Loving Hut is a vegan chain with multiple locations. Meals cost **$2-3**.

The 1st and 15th of each lunar month are vegetarian days in Buddhist tradition - many restaurants offer special menus.

### Coffee and Drinks

Vietnamese coffee is strong, sweet, and served over ice. A cup costs **$0.50-1.50** at local cafes.

Loading T Cafe (multiple locations) is popular with young Vietnamese. Avoid the chains near Hoan Kiem Lake - overpriced and touristy.

**Craft Beer Scene:**
- Pasteur Street Brewing - excellent IPAs, **$3-4 per pint**
- Furbrew (24 Ngo Huyện) - cozy spot with rotating taps
- BiaCraft - biggest selection
- Happy hour: 4-7pm with **$1-2 beers**
- Local bia hoi: **$0.30 per glass** (but weak)

### Night Markets

Weekend nights (Friday-Sunday), streets around Hoan Kiem Lake close to traffic and become walking markets. Food stalls set up selling everything from grilled squid to sweet desserts.

Prices are tourist-inflated but the atmosphere is fun. Expect to pay **$2-4** for most items.

### Street Food Tips

- Best food is at places with tiny plastic stools and no English menus
- If locals are eating there, it's good
- Point at what others are having if you can't read Vietnamese
- Most street food costs **$1-3**
- Eat where you see high turnover - fresh food is safe food
- Vegetarians: learn "toi an chay" (I eat vegetarian)

## Getting Around

### From the Airport

Noi Bai International Airport sits 45 minutes north of the city. Here are your options:

**Public Bus #86:** **$1.50** | Runs 6am-11pm | Drops you at Old Quarter | Slow but reliable

**Grab:** **$12-15** to city center | Split it if you meet other travelers

**Airport Taxis:** **$15-20** | Some drivers scam tourists, so stick with Grab or official stands

**Hotel Pickup:** **$15-25** | Worth it if arriving late or with lots of luggage

### Grab (Ride-Sharing App)

Download Grab before you arrive. It's cheaper than taxis and you don't need to haggle.

**Typical costs:** Most rides around the city cost **$1-3**

You can pay cash or by card. The app is in English. Xe om (motorbike taxis) on Grab are even cheaper but you'll need to hold your bag tight.

### Walking

The Old Quarter and French Quarter are walkable, but crossing streets is an adventure. Traffic never stops.

**The trick:** Walk slowly and steadily - motorbikes will flow around you. Don't make sudden movements.

It's terrifying at first but you'll get used to it. Wear comfortable shoes - sidewalks are uneven and often blocked by parked motorbikes.

### Other Transport Options

**Cyclo (Bicycle Rickshaw)**
Good for short trips or sightseeing, not practical for getting places quickly. Negotiate the price before getting in - expect **$3-5 for 30 minutes**.

**Rental Bikes and Motorbikes**
Many hostels rent bicycles for **$2-3 per day**. Great for visiting West Lake or quieter neighborhoods.

Motorbikes cost **$5-8/day** but Hanoi traffic is intense - only rent if you're an experienced rider. Helmets are mandatory.

## Practical Tips for Visiting Hanoi

### Cross Streets Confidently

Traffic never stops in Hanoi. To cross, step into the street and walk at a steady pace. Don't run, don't stop suddenly.

Motorbikes will swerve around you. It feels wrong but it works. Watch how locals do it and copy them.

### Essential Apps to Download

- **Grab** - for transport and food delivery
- **Google Maps** - for navigation (works offline if you download the map)
- **Google Translate** - for reading menus (camera function is magic)

### Dress Appropriately

Temples and government buildings require covered shoulders and knees. Carry a scarf or light pants.

**Winter (December-February):** Bring a light jacket - it gets surprisingly cold
**Summer (June-August):** Pack light, breathable clothes

### What to Pack

**Everyone needs:**
- Comfortable walking shoes (you'll walk 10-15km daily)
- Sunscreen (the sun is harsh)
- Insect repellent
- Hand sanitizer
- Toilet paper (many places don't provide it)
- Reusable water bottle
- Power adapter (Type A, C, or G)
- Photocopies of your passport

**Winter extras:**
- Light jacket
- Long pants
- Scarf

**Summer extras:**
- Light clothes
- Rain jacket
- Umbrella

**Leave at home:**
- Expensive jewelry
- Too many clothes (laundry is cheap - **$1-2 per kilo**)
- Heavy guidebooks (use your phone)

### ATMs and Money

ATMs are everywhere and most accept international cards. Withdraw from bank ATMs (Vietcombank, BIDV) not random machines to avoid scams.

**Maximum withdrawal:** 3-4 million VND ($120-160)

Notify your bank before traveling. Many places accept USD but give poor exchange rates - use VND. Don't change money at the airport (terrible rates) - use ATMs.

### Bargaining

Expected at markets and with street vendors, not in shops with price tags. Start at 50-60% of the asking price and negotiate up.

Smile and be friendly - aggressive bargaining doesn't work well here. If they won't budge, walk away - they'll often call you back with a better price.

### Scams to Avoid

- **Taxi drivers:** "Forget" to turn on meter or take long routes - use Grab instead
- **Cyclo drivers:** Agree to one price then demand more at the end - get it in writing
- **Street vendors near Hoan Kiem Lake:** Overcharge - walk a few blocks away
- **Motorbike rental scam:** Claim you damaged the bike - take photos before leaving

### Stay Healthy

- Drink bottled water only
- Brush teeth with bottled water too
- Street food is generally safe if the place is busy
- Avoid raw vegetables unless at a reputable restaurant
- Bring hand sanitizer
- Consider a face mask on bad air quality days
- Pharmacies are everywhere if you need basic medicine

### Safety First

Hanoi is very safe compared to most capital cities. Violent crime against tourists is rare.

**Main risks:**
- Pickpocketing
- Bag snatching from motorbikes

**Stay safe:**
- Keep your bag on the building side when walking, not the street side
- Don't flash expensive phones or cameras
- The Old Quarter gets sketchy late at night near bars - stay aware
- Never assume a car or motorbike will stop for you
- Sidewalks are often blocked - you'll walk in the street a lot

### Respect Local Customs

- Take shoes off before entering homes and some shops
- Dress modestly at temples
- Don't touch people's heads
- Don't point your feet at Buddha statues
- Don't get angry if something goes wrong - losing your temper makes Vietnamese people uncomfortable

### Learn Basic Vietnamese

- **Hello:** xin chào
- **Thank you:** cảm ơn
- **How much:** bao nhiêu
- **Delicious:** ngon
- **Beer:** bia

Locals appreciate any effort to speak Vietnamese, even if your pronunciation is terrible. Download a translation app and learn numbers 1-10 for bargaining.

### Best Times to Visit

**Best weather:** October-November and March-April (warm but not too hot, minimal rain)

**Cool season:** December-February (cool and can be drizzly but still pleasant)

**Avoid:** July-August if you hate heat and humidity

**Rainiest:** September

**Tet (Vietnamese New Year):** Late January or early February - everything closes for a week. Either avoid it or embrace the festive chaos.

### Visa Requirements

Most nationalities can get a visa on arrival or e-visa for Vietnam. Check current requirements before booking - rules change frequently.

**E-visas:** **$25**, takes 3 business days to process

Some nationalities get 15-30 days visa-free. Always verify the latest rules on the Vietnamese immigration website.

### Day Trips from Hanoi

**Ha Long Bay (Most Popular)**
Honestly, spend a night on a boat to really experience it. Day tours cost **$40-60** and involve 3-4 hours of driving each way. Book through a reputable operator, not random street agents.

**Ninh Binh (2.5 hours south)**
Stunning karst landscapes without the tourist crowds. Day tours cost **$25-35** and include boat rides through caves and temple visits. You can also go independently by bus for cheaper.

**Sapa (6 hours northwest)**
Needs at least 2 days - don't try it as a day trip. The mountain scenery and hill tribe villages are incredible but the journey is long.

**Perfume Pagoda (2 hours away)**
Half-day trip involving a boat ride and cable car to reach temples in the mountains. Tours cost **$20-30**. Go on weekdays to avoid Vietnamese tourist crowds.

### How Long to Stay

- **3 days minimum:** See main sights and eat your way through the city
- **5 days:** Add day trips and explore different neighborhoods
- **1 week:** Slow down, take cooking classes, live like a local
- **Months:** Many travelers stay for extended periods - Hanoi grows on you

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't** book tours through your hotel - they mark up prices 30-50%
- **Don't** eat only Western food - you're missing the point of Hanoi
- **Don't** skip street food because you're scared - it's safe and delicious
- **Don't** try to see everything in 2 days - slow down and enjoy it
