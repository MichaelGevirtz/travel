# SEO Fundamentals

> Core SEO principles based on Google's 2025/2026 guidelines and best practices.

## E-E-A-T Framework

Google evaluates content quality using **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness**:

### Experience
- Demonstrate first-hand experience with the topic
- Share personal insights, opinions, and real visits
- Include specific details only someone who "was there" would know
- Use first-person where appropriate: "I visited", "I recommend"

### Expertise
- Show deep knowledge of the subject matter
- Provide accurate, well-researched information
- Include specific data, prices, and verifiable facts
- Cite sources when making factual claims

### Authoritativeness
- Build reputation through consistent, quality content
- Earn backlinks from reputable travel sites
- Include author attribution with credentials
- Reference official sources (tourism boards, government sites)

### Trustworthiness
- Be transparent about affiliate relationships
- Provide accurate, up-to-date information
- Include publication and update dates
- Disclose when content is AI-assisted

## Google's Helpful Content Guidelines

Content must be **genuinely useful to readers**. Google penalizes:

### What to Avoid
- Thin content with little original value
- Content created primarily for search engines, not humans
- Summarizing others' content without adding value
- Keyword stuffing or unnatural keyword placement
- Mass-produced AI content without human oversight
- Clickbait titles that don't match content

### What Google Rewards
- Original insights and information
- Comprehensive coverage of topics
- Content that answers the user's actual question
- Clear, well-organized writing
- Content that provides value beyond what competitors offer
- Regularly updated, accurate information

## AI-Generated Content Guidelines

Google allows AI-generated content if it meets quality standards:

### Acceptable Use
- Using AI to research and structure content
- AI-assisted drafting with human editing and verification
- Automated generation of structured data from verified facts
- AI help with grammar, clarity, and organization

### Prohibited Use
- Mass-producing low-value pages to manipulate rankings
- Generating content without human review
- Creating content with "little to no effort, originality, or added value"
- Automated content that doesn't serve users

### Best Practices for AI Content
- Always have human oversight and editing
- Verify all factual claims independently
- Add original insights and personal experience
- Consider disclosing AI assistance where appropriate
- Ensure content meets the same standards as human-written content

## Core Web Vitals

Technical performance metrics that affect rankings:

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- Target: Under 2.5 seconds
- Measures how fast the main content loads
- Optimize images, use lazy loading, minimize blocking resources

### FID (First Input Delay) / INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
- Target: Under 100ms (FID) / Under 200ms (INP)
- Measures responsiveness to user interaction
- Minimize JavaScript execution, use web workers

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- Target: Under 0.1
- Measures visual stability (content jumping around)
- Set image dimensions, reserve space for ads/embeds

## On-Page SEO Essentials

### Title Tags
- Length: 50-60 characters (Google truncates longer titles)
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Make it compelling for clicks, not just keywords
- Each page needs a unique title
- Format: "Primary Topic | Brand Name" or "Primary Topic - Brand Name"

### Meta Descriptions
- Length: 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Write a compelling summary that encourages clicks
- Include a value proposition or call-to-action
- Each page needs a unique description

### URL Structure
- Keep URLs short and descriptive
- Use hyphens to separate words (not underscores)
- Include primary keyword
- Use lowercase only
- Avoid parameters when possible
- Example: `/vietnam/destinations/hanoi-travel-guide`

### Heading Hierarchy
- Single H1 per page containing primary keyword
- H2s for main sections (3-7 per article)
- H3s for subsections within H2s
- Never skip levels (H1 → H3 without H2)
- Headings should create a logical outline

### Content Optimization
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Keyword density: 1-2% (avoid stuffing)
- Use synonyms and related terms naturally (LSI keywords)
- Write for humans first, search engines second
- Answer the search intent directly

## Link Building Principles

### Internal Linking
- Minimum 3-5 internal links per article
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link to related, relevant content
- Create topic clusters linking to pillar pages
- Update old content with links to new content

### External Linking
- Link to authoritative sources to support claims
- Use `rel="nofollow"` for untrusted or paid links
- Link out adds credibility (don't hoard links)
- Choose reputable, relevant sources

### Earning Backlinks
- Create link-worthy content (data, guides, tools)
- Build relationships with travel bloggers/publications
- Guest posting on relevant sites
- Digital PR and expert quotes
- Focus on quality over quantity

## Mobile-First Indexing

Google primarily uses the mobile version of content for ranking:

- Ensure responsive design works on all devices
- Same content on mobile and desktop
- Fast loading on mobile networks
- Touch-friendly navigation and buttons
- Readable text without zooming
- No horizontal scrolling required

## Content Freshness

Freshness signals matter for travel content:

- Include publication date visibly
- Update content regularly (at least annually)
- Add "Last updated: [date]" when refreshing
- Include current year in time-sensitive info: "As of 2025..."
- Remove or update outdated prices, hours, and policies

## Things Google Ignores

Don't waste time on:

- Meta keywords tag (Google doesn't use it)
- Keyword density calculators (write naturally)
- Minimum/maximum word counts (quality matters, not length)
- Domain name keywords (minimal ranking impact)
- Submission to search engines (crawling is automatic)
