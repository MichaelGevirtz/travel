## Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords have lower volume but higher intent and less competition.

### Formula: [Modifier] + [Core Topic] + [Location] + [Intent]

**Examples:**
| Short-tail (Avoid) | Long-tail (Target) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| "Vietnam travel" | "2-week Vietnam itinerary for first-timers" |
| "Hanoi food" | "best street food in Hanoi Old Quarter" |
| "Vietnam beach" | "quiet beaches in Vietnam without tourists" |
| "Hoi An" | "day trip from Da Nang to Hoi An by motorbike" |

### High-Value Long-Tail Patterns for Travel

- "[number] days in [destination] itinerary"
- "best [type] hotels in [destination] for [audience]"
- "[destination] on a budget [year]"
- "[destination] vs [destination] which is better"
- "is [destination] worth visiting"
- "[destination] travel tips for [audience]"
- "hidden places to visit near [destination]" (use sparingly, match intent)

Start with obvious terms:
- [destination] travel guide
- things to do in [destination]
- [destination] itinerary

### Step 2: Expand with Modifiers
Add audience, budget, time modifiers:
- "for couples", "for families", "solo"
- "budget", "luxury", "mid-range"
- "3 days", "one week", "2 weeks"
- "[year]", "in [month]"

### Step 3: Check Search Intent
For each keyword, determine what users actually want:
- **Informational**: They want to learn → Write comprehensive guides
- **Transactional**: They want to book → Include booking CTAs
- **Navigational**: They want specific place → Provide directions/details

### Step 4: Assess Competition
Prioritize keywords where you can compete:
- Check top 10 results - can you create better content?
- Look for thin content in SERPs (opportunity)
- Target long-tail if short-tail is too competitive

## Seasonal Keywords

### Vietnam Weather/Timing

| Month | High-Volume Keywords |
|-------|---------------------|

| Jul-Aug | "sapa in july", "vietnam monsoon travel" |

- Add event-specific content before major holidays

## Keywords to Avoid

### Over-Competitive (Hard to Rank)
- "Vietnam" (too broad)
- "Vietnam travel" (too competitive)
- "best hotels" (dominated by booking sites)

### Low-Value (No Search Volume)
- Overly specific long-tail with no searches
- Misspellings (unless high-volume)
- Internal jargon users don't search

### Mismatched Intent

- Don't target "is vietnam safe" with a booking page
