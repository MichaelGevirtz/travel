# Writing Style Guide

Shared writing guidelines for all content writers (destinations, itineraries, guides).

## Voice and Tone

- **Casual and conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Simple English**: Use everyday words, avoid jargon and complex vocabulary
- **Helpful and practical**: Focus on actionable advice travelers can use
- **Authentic**: Share real insights, not generic travel clichés
- **Encouraging**: Make readers excited about their trip
- **Honest**: Mention drawbacks when relevant

## Writing Rules

### Do:
- Write in second person ("you", "your")
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Include specific prices in USD
- Give exact timeframes and distances
- Share insider tips and local knowledge
- Use active voice
- Break up text with subheadings (H3)

### Don't:
- Use passive voice
- Write long, dense paragraphs
- Be vague ("reasonably priced", "quite far")
- Copy from other sources
- Include outdated information
- Over-hype destinations
- Use complex vocabulary
- Make assumptions about reader knowledge
- Use emojis

## Banned Phrases

NEVER use these overused travel writing clichés:

| Banned Phrase | Use Instead |
|---------------|-------------|
| "hidden gem" / "hidden treasure" | "less touristy spot", "quieter alternative" |
| "off the beaten path" | "less touristy", "quieter alternative" |
| "must-see" | "worth visiting", "don't miss" |
| "breathtaking" / "stunning" | Be more specific about what makes it special |
| "paradise" / "slice of heaven" | Describe the actual appeal |
| "authentic experience" | Just describe what makes it authentic |
| "bustling streets" | Be more descriptive |
| "picture-perfect" | Describe specific visual elements |
| "quaint" | Be specific |
| "charming" | Only if you explain why |
| "explore" | Use "visit", "walk around", "check out" |

## UX & Content Formatting

**Core principle: Users scan, they don't read.**

### Scannability (Don't Make Me Think)

- Write short paragraphs: **2-4 sentences maximum** (never 5+)
- Use H3 subheadings every **200-300 words** within H2 sections
- Prefer bullet points over dense prose
- Put the most important information first
- Make hierarchy obvious at a glance
- Cut unnecessary words ruthlessly

### Bold Text Usage (Refactoring UI)

Use bold strategically for:
- **Prices** and ratings
- **Key numbers** and statistics
- **Labels** in quick facts (format: "**Label:** Value")
- **Important benefits** in lists

Don't bold entire paragraphs or sentences.

**Examples:**
- ✅ "**Price:** $25-35 per night"
- ✅ "**Best for:** Budget travelers and backpackers"
- ✅ "**Hanoi** (3 nights)" — for itinerary stops
- ❌ "**The hotel is located in the Old Quarter and offers great value**"

### Information Chunking (Miller's Law)

People can hold 5-7 items in working memory:
- Limit lists to **5-7 items** maximum
- Break longer lists into **categorized sub-sections**
- Example: Instead of "15 Things to Do", create 3 categories with 5 items each

### Serial Position Effect

People remember items at the **beginning and end** of lists best:
- Place most important recommendations **first or last**
- Don't bury key information in the middle
- Put the most exciting destination first or last in itineraries

### Data Specificity

Always include specific data with context:
- ✅ "Based on 2026 prices, budget travelers spend $25-35/day in Hanoi."
- ✅ "March temperatures average 22-28°C across central Vietnam."
- ❌ "Hanoi is affordable for budget travelers."
- ❌ "The weather is nice in spring."

### Writing for LLM Discovery

Make content citation-ready for AI systems:
- Include specific data with years: "As of 2026, daily costs average $30-50"
- Use question-answer format in FAQ sections
- Front-load answers (answer first, details after)
- Make facts quote-ready and verifiable

**Example:**
- ✅ "A 2-week Vietnam trip covers 2 regions comfortably, with time for both cities and nature."
- ❌ "Two weeks is a good amount of time for Vietnam."

## Example Writing

### Good Opening:
"Planning a trip to Hanoi? You're in for a treat. Vietnam's capital is a wild mix of old and new - ancient temples sit next to French colonial buildings, while motorbikes zip through streets filled with food vendors."

### Bad Opening:
"Hanoi is a breathtaking destination that offers an authentic glimpse into Vietnamese culture. This hidden gem is a must-see for travelers seeking to explore the bustling streets of this charming city."

### Good Recommendation:
"Try banh mi for $1-2 from vendors on Hang Ma Street. The crispy baguette, pickled vegetables, and grilled pork make it the perfect quick lunch."

### Bad Recommendation:
"Hanoi offers amazing street food that you must try for an authentic experience."
